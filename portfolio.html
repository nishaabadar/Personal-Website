    <h2>Activist Toolkit</h2>
    <img class="projectPic" src="assets/GunViolence.png"
      alt="A light yellow page with a red header with different tabs, and in the center, there is an image which has a yellow tape with 'Crime Scene Do Not Cross' written on it, and on top of the image, 'Gun Violence' is boldly written in red, and below the image there is a link to the source of the image and a header which reads 'What is Gun Violence?'.">
    <p>This is a website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it spreads awareness about a global issue
      which is Gun Violence.</p>

    <p>This is a program that I recently created within a team which makes calculations and conclusions based on real
      data collected by Statistics Canada about the prevalence of diabetes in Canada in its four most populated
      provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta). We created this project using C on Replit.</p>
